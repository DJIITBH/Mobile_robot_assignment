Running the Package

1. Launching the Controller

The velocity controller can be launched using:

ros2 launch bumperbot_controller controller.launch.py

This will:

Start the velocity controller.

Publish the odometry frame.

Compute differential kinematics from wheel encoder values using /joint_states.

Parameters

You can provide the necessary arguments like wheelbase, max RPM, and wheel radius:

ros2 launch bumperbot_controller controller.launch.py wheelbase:=0.5 max_rpm:=150 wheel_radius:=0.11

2. Running Waypoint Navigation

The waypoint navigation script can be executed using:

ros2 run bumperbot_controller waypoint_navigation.py

To provide specific waypoints as arguments:

ros2 run bumperbot_controller waypoint_navigation.py --ros-args -p waypoint_1_x:=20.0

Additional Notes

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the package.

Modify the parameters according to your robotâ€™s specifications.

Test in a simulation environment before deploying on hardware.
